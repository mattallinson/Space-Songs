# Songs In Space
*NASA Wake Up Songs*

## About
NASA used to play music to wake up its astronauts, and this repo documents every song they played of which records exist, and when. The data was originally collated by Coline Fries at NASA, and I will soon have turned it into a machine-readable database. 

Currently this repo contains jupyter notebooks that are being used to wrangle the data, and half finished versions of that data themselves.
